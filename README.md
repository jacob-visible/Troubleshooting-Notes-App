# Troubleshooting-Notes-App
The point of this application is to create a resource for troubleshooting. It creates your notes but also can link to relevant local or online websites that show more detailed steps for troubleshooting. The right side section can be disabled. It can sit on top of other windows or not. You can use the number keys or just click the buttons to select common issues you need to troubleshoot and it will add the troubleshooting to your notes in the box at the bottom. At the end you can hit the resolve button and it will copy the text there and you can control v in your ticketing software.
